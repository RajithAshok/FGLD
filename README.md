# Flammable Gas Leak Detector
 
<p>This device has been designed with safety in mind. Every day, more than 350 million individuals in our nation utilise LPG cylinders. Gas leaks are reported across the country on a daily basis. Many of these people lack the education necessary to address these issues quickly. With this device, we hope to identify gas leaks early on and alert users before any accidents happen. We also want to assist the customer in identifying when the cylinder is about to expire so they may replace it.</p>
<p>The strategy we've chosen calls for a gas detection sensor (MQ6 - LPG Propane Gas Sensor Module) that needs to be fitted adjacent to the gas cylinder and the pipe that supplies the stove with gas. We may directly transmit the data to the user's mobile device by integrating a wifi module into the sensor. Gas flow rate sensors are used to calculate the end of the LPG cylinder. The numbers are compared to our data set, which we obtained by carefully measuring the volume of gas in a typical LPG cylinder.</p>
<p>With the help of IoT, we want to create a safer world, whether at home or in a factory, by carefully monitoring the pipes. When used, especially in high-risk areas, this technology has the potential to save countless lives.
